## 1. Information we collect

### 1.1 Non-Personal Data

Like most website operators, we collect Non-Personal Data such as browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.

We collect this to understand how our visitors and members use our service, and use it to make decisions about how to change and adapt the service.

From time to time, we may release Non-Personal Data in aggregate form (for instance, by publishing trends in site usage) to explain our reasoning in making decisions. We will not release individual information, only aggregate information.

### 1.2 Personal Data

Personal Data is anything which can be used to identify or contact you, such as your legal name, email address, IP address, or physical location.

#### 1.2.1 Automatically collected Personal Data

We automatically collect some Personal Data, such as IP address, provided by your browser and your computer whenever you visit SecurityBot via securitybot.mrrrgn.com.

We collect this information for several purposes:

* To diagnose and repair network issues with your use of the site;
* To estimate the number of users accessing the service from specific geographic regions;
* To help prevent fraud and abuse.

## 2. Storing your information

Files may be stored in the apps folder within your Dropbox (Apps/SecurityBot).

## 3. Deleting your information

Files stored in the apps folder within your Dropbox (Apps/SecurityBot) may be deleted from time to time to conserve storage space.  Any retention of this information past this point is out of SecurityBot's purview.

## 4. Changes

We may change our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will take reasonable steps to notify you of any substantial changes to this Policy; however, it is your responsibility to check this Policy periodically for changes.
